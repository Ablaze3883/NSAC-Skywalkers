# Skywalkers
NASA Space App Challenge
Team Skywalkers has a motto of “Amicable Problem Solving in Outer Space” and that is what we have set out to do. We have worked on making a tool that can access the archives of space agencies’ data effectively and quickly and present it in an appealing way that is accessible to everyone whether they are familiar with the field of astronomy or not. Our aim was to find a discernible middle ground for both casual visitors and professionals who needed a quick reference to the data provided by these agencies.
Simple Image Access Protocol is being used to get a hold of the jpeg and FITS images of the desired celestial bodies and Simple Spectal Protocol is being used to get plots and graphs of the data received from x-ray and uv observatories and satellites, for example: The Chandra Observatory and International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite. We worked on obtaining UV and X-ray images of the desired celestial bodies from the Chandra Observatory, Spitzer and Galex satellites and other observatories.We will be working on front-end and UI/UX development for the webpage. They will be doing their best to make it as accessible as possible without sacrificing data credibility.
